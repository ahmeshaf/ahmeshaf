Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at CU Boulder. My research focuses on understanding events in natural language, detecting important textual cues, and finding common threads in linguistic variations. I earned my Bachelor's degree from IIT Hyderabad and a Master's from CU Boulder.

I've got five years of industry experience at HP, where I led the NLP group and even secured a patent for stochastic modeling of troubleshooting steps. I also completed two internships at Explosion.ai, the creators of spaCy, which led to two published papers.

During my academic journey, I was a research assistant on two DARPA projects. I spearheaded the development of knowledge graph construction methods for unstructured texts from news articles with conflicting reports. My research has led to eight publications, including five as the first author in the past year and my first ACL Main acceptance.

Overall, my work bridges advanced NLP techniques with real-world applications, driving innovation in language understanding, processing, annotations, and creating efficient methods.
